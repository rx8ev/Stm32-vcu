# Compiling
You will need the arm-none-eabi toolchain: https://developer.arm.com/open-source/gnu-toolchain/gnu-rm/downloads
On Linux this can be installed by typing:

`sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi`

The only external depedencies are libopencm3 and libopeninv. You can download and build this dependency by typing

`make get-deps`

Now you can compile stm32-vcu by typing

`make`

# Tests

Build the tests

`make Tests`

Run the tests

`./test/test_vcu`

And upload it to your board using a JTAG/SWD adapter, the updater.py script or the esp8266 web interface

I use CodeBlocks IDE :  https://www.codeblocks.org/

Sept 21 : V1 hardware and firmware from "Master" branch now running in my E46 Touring and E39 vehicles.

March 24 : V1.1 Hardware and V2.05A firmware now running in 3 vehicles :

-BMW E39 with Lexus GS450H Drivetrain, Tesla PCS, ISA Shunt , Chademo Fast Charge

-BMW E46 Touring with Nissan Leaf Gen 1 Drivetrain, Outlander Charger / DCDC, ISA Shunt , CCS Fast Charge

-BMW E31 with Tesla LDU Drivetrain, Tesla DCDC, ISA Shunt , Chademo Fast Charge

All hardware / software is tested in these vehicles before release. More vehicles with different configuration in progress to ensure as much testing as possible.
